JPA Inheritance Strategies: Implemented by the javax.persistence.Inheritance annotation

The following mapping strategies are used to map the entity data to the underlying database:

▪ A single table per class hierarchy
- Table creation for each entity
- A table defined for each concrete class in the inheritance
- Allows inheritance to be used in the object model, when it does not exist in the data model
- Querying root or branch classes can be very difficult and inefficient

▪ A table per concrete entity class

▪ "Join" strategy – mapping common fields in a single table
